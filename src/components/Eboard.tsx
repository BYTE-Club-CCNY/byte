Hackathons have shown me a whole new side of software engineering communities that I wish to replicate here in CCNY. I believe that by building projects with likeminded driven SWEs, we can create a community that fosters growth and learning. I use Linux btw ðŸ¤“",

I am dedicated to BYTE due to my own life experiences; When I was a freshman and sophomore, I lacked the necessary resources needed to build my own projects. My hope with BYTE is to help CCNY students who were in similar spots as myself grow their skills, become ready for real-world applications, and ideally land a MAANG internship.
