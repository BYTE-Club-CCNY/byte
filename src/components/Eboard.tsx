        "My dedication to this club comes from my passion for community & project building. Hackathons have shown me a whole new side of software engineering communities that I wish to replicate here in CCNY. I believe that by building projects with likeminded driven SWEs, we can create a community that fosters growth and learning. I use Linux btw ðŸ¤“",

        "Many of you may know me, but my name is Baljinder. I'm a CS major passionate about ML and AI. I am dedicated to BYTE due to my own life experiences; When I was a freshman and sophomore, I lacked the necessary resources needed to build my own projects. My hope with BYTE is to help CCNY students who were in similar spots as myself grow their skills, become ready for real-world applications, and ideally land a MAANG internship. My hobbies include reading, gaming, and playing sports (basketball, volleyball, and rock climbing). BTW I'm the cool Eboard member ðŸ¦…",

        "My motivation for founding this club stems from my fascination with the driven, competitive, and social nature of hackathons, alongside my desire to find a community embodying these qualities at City College. At our school, I noticed a disconnect among Computer Science students and a lack of facilities providing hands-on experience with guidance. Through BYTE, I aim to mentor members with my knowledge and advice, guide them in building their projects, and create an environment for growth and success.",
