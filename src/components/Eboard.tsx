Hackathons have shown me a whole new side of software engineering communities that I wish to replicate here in CCNY. I believe that by building projects with likeminded driven SWEs, we can create a community that fosters growth and learning. I use Linux btw ðŸ¤“",

I am dedicated to BYTE due to my own life experiences; When I was a freshman and sophomore, I lacked the necessary resources needed to build my own projects. My hope with BYTE is to help CCNY students who were in similar spots as myself grow their skills, become ready for real-world applications, and ideally land a MAANG internship. My hobbies include reading, gaming, and playing sports (basketball, volleyball, and rock climbing). BTW I'm the cool Eboard member ðŸ¦…",

              "My motivation for founding this club stems from my fasciation by the driven, competitive, and social nature of hackathons alongside my own desire to find a community that has those qualities within City College. I felt like there was a disconnect between Computer Science students, and a lack of fascilities to provide hands on experience with some guidance within our school. Through BYTE, my goal is to mentor members with advice and knowledge I know, guide them through building their projects, and create an environment for growth and success. \n\n Currently a junior and graduating May 2025. My hobbies include but not limited to trying new things, sports, writing and reading. 'Iâ€™m so first class, I can hand out a syllabus'",
